# Lyrics Analysis

This is a program written in Python that uses the Genius API to do a simple lyrical analysis on any given artist.
The user enters any artist's name, along with their choice of the amount of songs to perform the analysis on, and
they are given a list including total words, total unique words, and the length of the longest word. The artistlyrics.json
file is updated and overwritten each time a new artist is requested.
